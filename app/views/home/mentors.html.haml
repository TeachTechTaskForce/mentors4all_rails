%h3 Apply To Become a Mentor

%p Welcome to mentors4all! Our goal is to match up as many mentors (computer science professionals and students) with CS teachers as possible to support Chicago's CS4All initiative.

%p Mentoring is a great chance to practice what you know!

%p Mentors are professionals, undergrads/grads, or other computer science experts that are interested in providing in-classroom or out-of-classroom assistance to new CS teachers. A good mentor will model computational thinking for the students (ask students the right questions and you don't have to give them the answers), and work deliberately with the teacher to improve their knowledge of computer science and computational thinking.

%p Please Note:
%p please sign up with the intent of coming to a classroom on a regular basis. It takes time to build a good relationship and really enhance a classroom.
mentors are not meant to supplant the teacher's role during classroom instructional time. Leading an activity is all right, but the teacher is the authority in their classroom!
